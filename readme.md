```shell script
# execute
for tool in tools/*; do chmod u+x $tool; done
```

That's it. Now modify and use (or use unmodified) these tools as day-by-day helpers.

To speed up the search for the right tool, you can press **F3**/**Ctrl+F** in your viewer when you're on this page
and type the _most relevant_ keyword. I hope that something will be found.
